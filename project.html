            <p class="padding">July 2022 - Present<br>

                Building Civics Unplugged was a dream.</p>

            <p class="padding">Beyond the joy of supporting so many young civic innovators explore their passions and
                skills,
                I am grateful for how much time it gave me to explore the roots of civilizational decline and fragility.
            </p>
            <p>Given the growing number of existential risks facing Americans and all of humanity,
                my research has showed me that there may be nothing more important to humanity's long-term
                flourishing than investing in and building what I call <b>"foundational technologies",</b>
                that enable hyperlocal resilience, self-sustainability, dynamism, and ecological regeneration.</p>
            <ul>
                <li class="padding">How do we build villages and cities of the future that are not only not extractive,
                    they leave the environment around them better off?</li>
                <li class="padding">How do we fund people and projects that generate and regenerate what matters?</li>
                <li class="padding">How can communities prepare for the worst, and simultaneously plant seeds for a new
                    Golden
                    Age for the U.S. (and all of humanity)?</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="padding"><b>I am dedicating this newest chapter of my life to exploring questions like these,
                    advising high-impact projects, and creating new impactful projects of my own.

                <b>New York, NY</b>
            </p>
            <p class="padding">In May 2019, I broke Google's "Golden Handcuffs" because it became clear to me
                that if far more isn’t done to train a new generation of leaders committed to civic innovation,
                humanity will sink under the weight of its greatest challenges—including the climate crisis,
                skyrocketing inequality, and rising geopolitical tensions.</p>

            <p>This is where Civics Unplugged came in.<b> I co-founded CU to empower Gen Z civic innovators
                    to direct their passions, creativity, and idealism toward building a better future.</b></p>
            <p class="padding">I spent three years doing anything and everything to get CU off the
                ground—organizationa design, branding and marketing, community building, mentoring,
                curriculum design and delivery, and fundraising support.</p>
            <p class="padding">It was an incredibly rewarding experience. We gained partners and
                supporters like Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson, Andrew Yang, Coinbase, Ethereum Foundation,
                and the Smithsonian, and trained close to 2,000 students across 70+ countries.
                And importantly, we achieved financial and operational sustainability.</p>

                    watch this conversation I participated in with University of Toronto
                    professor Jonathan Vervaeke in October 2020.</li>
                <li>In January 2022, Civics Unplugged entered the world of web3 by
                    launching the Dream DAO, which builds the web3 x social impact ecosystem and
                    empowers Gen Zers to learn web3 and leverage its power to change the world.

                    out of the water.</li>
